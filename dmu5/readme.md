# DMU5 Catalogue creation, comparisons, and diagnostics

In this folder we take the LSST stack outputs from DMU4 and stack the catalogues to make all field or even all sky catalogues.

This is done using the isInner flags to remove overlap regions.

TODO: decide which columns to include in final catalogues. Which photometry do we consider standard? Can we get the HSC scripts to generate these catalogues and ingest them to whatever DAC we plan to use?
