# PanSTARRS catalogue for photometric and astrometric calibration

This is a reduced PanSTARRS catalogue in the LSST format to be used by the LSST photometric stack for calibrating raw exposure images. It has been cut at 19th magnitude to reduce its size. We may wish to use teh full catalogue for final processing.

This is currently being used for testing. There is a fits file for each 'shard'.

See the discussion here:

For testing we used the light version cut at 19 mag in r made by James Mullaney. The full version can be downlaoded here:
