# VISTA data products

This folder contains the VISTA community pipeline images and tile catalogues for the surveys VIDEO, VHS, and VIKING.

There is a folder for each night with invididual pointings:

$SURVEY_NAME/$YYYYMMDD/v$YYYYMMDD_$EXPNUM.fit

along with stacks for each pointing '_st.fit', and the corresponding '_st_conf.fit' confidence maps and the catalogues '_st_cat.fits' and the same three files for the tiles (a colllection of six pointings). Tiles contain a single ? x ? image where pointings and stacks contain the 16 CCD images.
