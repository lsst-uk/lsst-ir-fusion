# 2MASS photometric calibration catalogues

This product contains the 2MASS All-Sky Catalogue of Point Sources (Cutri et al., 2003). Its full documentation is available here: http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/Cat?II/246

The final all sky point source catalog was downloaded from:

No restraints were put on the query.

We make 2MASS photometric reference cataloguyes as a test but they are superseeded by bootstrapped VISTA reference catalogeus which are themselves cal;ibrated against 2MASS. See [dmu2](../../dmu2/) for more information.
