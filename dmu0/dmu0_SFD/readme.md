# E(B-V) maps
To compute the E(B-V) at each source position, we are using the sfdmap package that needs the Schlegel, Finkbeiner & Davis (1998) dust maps. The script get_sfd_maps.sh will download them and place them in the directory herschelhelp_internal/sfd_data/ where they can be accessed . This must be done only once.
