# VISTA imaging

## Headers and meta data

The wcs headers are deprecated and will not work with matplotlib. They will probably need to be updated to be run through the LSST pipelines.

## Warping the images

Do we need to warp the VISTA imaging to the LSST pixel base?

## Butler

Butler is a python class for handing data. We need to modify this to serve VISTA data.
