# Getting started with the development of the LSST IR fusion pipeline

In this document I will give some general advice on getting started with developing the LSST IR fusion pipeline and provide soome ideas for future development.

## Conduct a small local run

The first thing you should try to do is conduct a small test run on your laptop wioth the latest version of the LSST Science Pipelines. 

## Conduct a rerun of the SXDS VIDEO data on CSD3

After you have confirmed that the code will run on your laptop you shoudl attempt a rerun of the SXDS VIDEO run on the CSD3 system using the Batch Processing Service with the parsl backend and the Slurm queing system.
