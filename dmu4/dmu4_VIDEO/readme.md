# SXDS HSC DUD and VISTA VIDEO catalogues

The SXDS field is covered by the VIDEO, VIKING, and VHS VISTA surveys in addition to the HyperSuprimeCam PDR2 Deep and Ultra Deep data. 
We therefore chose this field as a prototype field. 
We periodically run the full pipeline over all bands that cover the 219 pacthes with VIDEO imaging.
We also have SExtractor 'dual mode' VISTA-HSC catalogues on this field which we use as a baseline comparitor for the photometric and astrometric solution.

Please not that these are prototype catalogues. In addition to issues we hqve already found we anticipate further issues to continuously discovered.
We therefore ask that anybody using the catalogues take care especially when using the data to produce scientific results.
