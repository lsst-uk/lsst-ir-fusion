# LSST pipeline catalogues

This folder contains the main results from the project. Here we will store the final multiband detected HSC-VISTA and eventually LSST-VISTA catalogues.

To begin, we will attempt to replicate the standard HSC processing described in the introductory tutorial

https://pipelines.lsst.io/getting-started/data-setup.html

We will attempt this through a notebook. The subsequent notebooks will attempt to progress toward the final aim of taking detections from all HSC and VISTA catalogues and combining them to make a final measurement catalogue.
