# DMU6 Photometric redshifts

In this directory we take the large area catalogues from DMU5 and compute photometric redshifts. At this stage this is to test performance. As a first pass we are using the method of Duncan et al 2017,2018. The code is available here:

https://github.com/dunkenj/eazy-pype

It is a modifcation of the EaZY code. The code there was originally optimized for the same XMM-LSS field with the same underlying data albeit with additional bands.
