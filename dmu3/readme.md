# SExtractor baseline catalogues

These catalogues are produced entirely independently of the processing here and are therefore useful for quantitative checks of the photometry pipeline. These catalogues were produced by Rebecca Bowler. There are both HSC-I selected and VISTA-Ks selected catalogues from SExtractor's dual band mode.

These were downloaded from

Description from email:

These are 2'' diameter aperture catalogues.  The key columns:
HSC-I, HSC-G, Ks etc = uncorrected 2'' aperture magnitudes from Source Extractor
flux_HSC-I, flux_HSC-G, flux_Ks = point-source aperture corrected fluxes in cgs units (ergs/s/cm2)
err_HSC-I, err_HSC-G, err_Ks = 1 sigma errors for the flux measurements (again in cgs) taken from a local depth measurement
