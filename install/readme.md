# Installation

In order to make running the code reproducible we are scripting the installation. In this directory we will install each weekly as a separate directory which can then be called by the setup script.

You will need to first run the sinple script which downloads the weekly install script and runs the first stage. The second stage can take more time so is submitted to Slurm.

We broadly follow the installation procedure described in:

https://pipelines.lsst.io/install/index.html

and

The photometric redshift estimation requires the installation of LePhare described here:
